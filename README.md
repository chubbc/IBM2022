Invited lectures given at the <a href="https://www.ibm.com/quantum/summer-school">2022 IBM QEC Summer school</a> on a statistical mechanical perspective on decoding quantum codes. The slides are prepared using <a href="https://github.com/chubbc/manim_slides">manim_slides</a>, my slide presentation system built upon <a href="https://www.manim.community/">manim</a> (specifically ManimCE 0.7.0 in this case).

The slides are viewable <a href="https://christopherchubb.com/IBM2022">here</a>. This slide preparation system is loborious, and still rather experimental. Any comments and recommendations are very much encouraged, I am still very much ironing out the kinks.
